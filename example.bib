title = {Looking for ultralight dark matter near supermassive black holes},
journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
abstract = {Measurements of the dynamical environment of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are becoming abundant and precise. We use such measurements to look for ultralight dark matter (ULDM), which is predicted to form dense cores (“solitons”) in the centre of galactic halos. We search for the gravitational imprint of an ULDM soliton on stellar orbits near Sgr A* and by combining stellar velocity measurements with Event Horizon Telescope imaging of M87*. Finding no positive evidence, we set limits on the soliton mass for different values of the ULDM particle mass m. The constraints we derive exclude the solitons predicted by a naive extrapolation of the soliton-halo relation, found in DM-only numerical simulations, for 2×10−20 eV≲ m≲8×10−19 eV (from Sgr A*) and m≲4×10−22 eV (from M87*). However, we present theoretical arguments suggesting that an extrapolation of the soliton-halo relation may not be adequate: in some regions of the parameter space, the dynamical effect of the SMBH could cause this extrapolation to over-predict the soliton mass by orders of magnitude.}

    abstract = {We explore the effect of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) on the density profile of a fuzzy dark matter (FDM) soliton core at the centre of a dark matter (DM) halo. We numerically solve the Schrödinger–Poisson equations, treating the black hole as a gravitational point mass, and demonstrate that this additional perturbing term has a ‘squeezing’ effect on the soliton density profile, decreasing the core radius, and increasing the central density. In the limit of large black hole mass, the solution approaches one akin to the hydrogen atom, with radius inversely proportional to the black hole mass. By applying our analysis to two specific galaxies (M87 and the Milky Way) and pairing it with known observational limits on the amount of centrally concentrated DM, we obtain a constraint on the FDM particle mass, finding that the range 10−22.12 eV ≲ m ≲ 10−22.06 eV should be forbidden (taking into account additional factors concerning the lifetime of the soliton in the vicinity of a black hole). Improved observational mass measurements of the black hole and total enclosed masses will significantly extend the lower bound on the excluded FDM mass region, while self-consistent theoretical modelling of the soliton–black hole system can extend the upper bound.},

journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
abstract = {We consider the spike mass density profile in a dark halo by self-consistently solving the relativistic Bondi accretion of dark matter onto a non-spining black hole of mass M. We assume that the dominant component of the dark matter in the halo is a Standard model gauge-singlet scalar. Its mass m ≃ 10-5 eV and quartic self-coupling λ ≲ 1019 are constrained to be compatible with the properties of galactic dark halos. In the hydrodynamic limit, we find that the accretion rate is bounded from below, M min = 96πG 2 M 2 m 4/λħ 3. Therefore, for M = 106  M⊙ we have M min ≃ 1.41 × 10-9  M ⊙ yr-1, which is subdominant compared to the Eddington accretion of baryons. The spike density profile ρ 0(r) within the self-gravitating regime cannot be fitted well by a single-power law but a double-power one. Despite that, we can fit ρ 0(r) piecewise and find that ρ 0(r) ∝ r -1.20 near the sound horizon, ρ 0(r) ∝ r -1.00 towards the Bondi radius and ρ 0(r) ∝ r -1.08 for the region in between. This contrasts with more cuspy ρ 0(r) ∝ r -1.75 for dark matter with Coulomb-like self-interaction.}

journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
abstract = {Superfluid dark matter, consisting of self-interacting light particles  that thermalize and condense to form a superfluid in galaxies, provides a novel theory that matches the success of the standard ΛCDM model on cosmological scales while simultaneously offering a rich phenomenology on galactic scales. Within galaxies, the dark matter density profile consists of a nearly homogeneous superfluid core surrounded by an isothermal envelope. In this work we compute the density profile of superfluid dark matter around supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies. We show that, depending on the fluid equation of state, the dark matter profile presents distinct power-law behaviors, which can be used to distinguish it from the standard results for collisionless dark matter.}

abstract = {We present novel findings concerning the parameter space of axion stars, extended object forming in dense dark matter environments through gravitational condensation. We emphasize their formation within the dense minihalos that potentially surround primordial black holes and in axion miniclusters. Our study investigates the relation between the radius and mass of an axion star in these dense surroundings, revealing distinct morphological characteristics compared to isolated scenarios. We explore the implications of these results when applied to the bound state between a primordial black hole and an axion star and the gravitational microlensing from extended objects, leading to insights on the observational constraints from such “halo” axion stars. We provide a constraint on the fraction of the galactic population of axion stars from their contribution to the microlensing events from the EROS-2 survey, using the numerical resolution of the Schrödinger-Poisson equation.}
